LDA stands for "Linked Data for Applications"

LDA is a framework and libraries for implementing integrated systems made up of one or more individual applications implemented using Linked Data technologies.
Linked Data provides the technology for integrating these applications into a system, by imposing a regular structure on the interfaces of the individual applications.
The interface structure is composed of a strict hypertext-linking REST API along with a regular data model based on RDF.
